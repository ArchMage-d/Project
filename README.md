Here's a video showing a working website.
The website isn't finished though, it lacks the working login feature(even though it checks the compatibility between hashes) and deleting posts from the site. 
Tech stack I used:
- Express.js for backend,
- React.js for frontend,
- MySQL for database management,
- Jest for testing
